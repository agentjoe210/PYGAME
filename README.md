# PYGAME
This program was written to perform a game for entertainment purposes. It uses a dictionary as places within a map and sewts cvertain items within each location. The code then analyzes what is in your inventory to tell you if you can survive a room or not. I think I did the functions very well but they could have been in seperate folders to enhance readability.
